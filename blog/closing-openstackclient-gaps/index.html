    <p>The unified OpenStack command-line client project, <code>python-openstackclient</code>
(OSC), has been around <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient/commit/f4b5ef39f6f84e66af532583040c9be7556e9b69">for over a decade</a>. As noted in the
<a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient/blob/master/README.rst">README</a>, &ldquo;[t]he primary goal is to provide a unified shell command
structure and a common language to describe operations in OpenStack.&rdquo; In
essence, this means OSC should replace the shell command implementations of the
various project-specific clients, such as <code>python-novaclient</code> and
<code>python-glanceclient</code>. It <em>does not</em> aim to replace the client library
implementations (Python binding) of these libraries: that task is handled by
another project, the unified OpenStack client library, <code>openstacksdk</code> (SDK).</p>
<p>For most high-level &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; OpenStack-related activities, OSC has long been
&ldquo;good enough&rdquo; as it provided the ability to do CRUD operations on the essential
resources in a cloud including instances, volumes and images. However, as soon
as you started trying to use more advanced or less common features, you&rsquo;d run
into a swathe of feature gaps. These would generally mean having to revert to
using the legacy project-specific clients like <code>python-novaclient</code> (e.g. <code>nova foo</code>) or <code>python-glanceclient</code> (<code>glance foo</code>). There were exceptions to this,
most notably <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-neutronclient/commit/3a64a7a166be25d40436fd40c8351a79267bd3c4">neutronclient</a>, but ultimately the
result of this partial switchover was a poor user experience that was more
confusing than it should have been.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past number of cycles (starting with Train), there has
been a concerted effort to close these gaps and achieve feature parity between
the shells of the various legacy clients and OSC. As of Yoga, we have
effectively achieved this for <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-novaclient/commit/0fb7190c062a08a3969a71955c014e3a572cdc9e">nova</a> and are well on
our way to doing so for <a href="https://review.opendev.org/q/topic:cinder-gaps">cinder</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve put together a little FAQ below that should be helpful in helping people
understand what has gone into this effort and how you can identify features
gaps to to be closed.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-determine-where-these-gaps-lie">How do we determine where these gaps lie?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, pretty manually. OSC only aims to implement support for the six
&ldquo;core&rdquo; services: nova, neutron, keystone, cinder, glance, and swift. We provide
<a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-openstackclient/tree/master/doc/source/cli/data">CSV files</a> mapping commands found in the legacy clients with their
OSC equivalents. The first step is looking for obvious gaps in this document,
by which I mean missing entries for an OSC equivalent to a given legacy client
command.</p>
<aside class="admonition note">
	
	
	<div class="admonition-content">OSC doesn&rsquo;t aim to provide a 1:1 mapping to the underlying APIs it calls which
means there are commands that we will never implement. However, these should be
explicitly called out with <code>WONTFIX</code> comments</div>
</aside>

<p>The next step is looking for command that should exist in those documents but
don&rsquo;t. This is pretty easy: just run e.g. <code>nova help</code>, capture the output, and
reformat it so that it resembles the CSV file (this would actually be one of
the few good places where scripting could help!). It&rsquo;s worth noting that many
of the legacy clients change their help output depending on the API version
requested so you should run this a couple of times with different API versions.
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>$ OS_COMPUTE_API_VERSION<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>2.88 nova help
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The final and most involved step required is examining individual commands.
There are two things we&rsquo;re concerned with: missing options and missing
microversion support. Assessing the first can be achieved similarly to
identifying missing commands: just run e.g. <code>nova help boot</code>, capture the
output and compare the options supported with those supported by the
equivalent OSC command (<code>openstack server create</code> in this case). The second
is a little trickier and usually involves manual inspection of the
corresponding shell and client library code in the legacy code. You could also
look at the API reference documentation for the particular service but projects
like Cinder have large documentation gaps that means the client is a better
source of truth.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-fix-them">How do I fix them?</h2>
<p>Just push a patch. It probably makes sense to push a highly WIP patch first
since OSC has some design conventions, noted in the <a href="https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/contributor/">contributor
guide</a>, which can take some time to get a feel for. There
are also plenty of existing examples to look for: search for the topics
<code>cinder-gaps</code> and <code>nova-gaps</code> to get an idea.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-non-core-projects">What about non-&ldquo;core&rdquo; projects?</h2>
<p>OSC is built on top of <a href="https://github.com/openstack/osc-lib"><code>osc-lib</code></a>, which is in turn built on top of
<a href="https://github.com/openstack/cliff"><code>cliff</code></a>. <code>cliff</code> is highly extensible and provides a number of hook
points that allow users to build plugins which can extend an existing CLI tool.
Projects like <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-manilaclient/blob/2c3d29313c18015f73982269401761608b9ece45/setup.cfg#L34-L155"><code>manila</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-ironicclient/blob/489bb43058d446a577377cff5828e98d13c79967/setup.cfg#L29-L127"><code>ironic</code></a> and
<a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-cyborgclient/blob/501d9f3e2c3a161b2ec0ae433d6c8b1f4ae32ea9/setup.cfg#L31-L52"><code>cyborg</code></a> all provide their own OSC plugins. This is also the
mechanism that neutron uses to provide <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-neutronclient/blob/7467c710f624aee80de8ef487e5b2c0e78143214/setup.cfg#L32-L172">more advanced commands</a>.
Many of these projects never had a legacy client to speak of, so there are
fewer (if any) gaps to worry about.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-openstacksdk">What about OpenStackSDK?</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;re working on that too and the work has been mostly going on in parallel.
There has been debate on whether newly added commands should use SDK or the
legacy client under the hood. I tend to favour using the latter first and
switching to SDK later since it makes it easier to compare the OSC and legacy
client shell implementations during development and review. In addition, an OSC
command can sometimes be the first real-world user of the SDK implementation
which can highlight bugs. This is particularly an issue for the quirkier, less
utilized APIs. It would be a shame to get stuck implementing an OSC command due
to an SDK bug. The sole exception to this is where library clients have removed
support for an API, such as Cinder dropping support for API v2 in <a href="https://github.com/openstack/python-cinderclient/commit/cb5235250cc10957b4392764b1dc3a6757784da5">cinderclient
9.0.0</a>. In this case, we&rsquo;ve no choice but to use SDK.</p>
