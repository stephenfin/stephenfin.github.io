  <article>
    <p>Next Friday is the last week of this stint at Intel, so I figured now was as
good a time as ever to do a write up on how I work, or, more accurately, how
I&rsquo;ve worked, during my time here. Note that this has evolved massively over the
past three years, so expect what I say now to have changed significantly a year
down the line.</p>
<p>At the moment, I work predominantly on <a href="https://github.com/openstack/nova">nova</a>, though I contribute to
many other projects like <a href="https://github.com/openstack/openstack-manuals">openstack-manuals</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/openstack/oslo.config">oslo.config</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openstack-dev/devstack">DevStack</a> and <a href="https://github.com/getpatchwork/patchwork">Patchwork</a>.
Not all of these projects are OpenStack projects, but they are all
Python-based, meaning the development environments for each tend to be rather
similar.</p>
<h2 id="platform">Platform</h2>
<p>First up - my development platform. My current work laptop is a tad
bit&hellip;under-resourced (think: 4GB of RAM) and is Windows-based, meaning I
always end up working on remote machines via SSH (more on that later). The
remote machines I use vary depending on what I want to do. Most of the time I
use a handful of VMs provided via an internal cloud. These provide me with a
shared home directory (so I don&rsquo;t have to configure Vim each time I start using
a new VM, heh) and some flexibility for things like basic multi-node testing.
However, when I need to validate features on real hardware (which happens quite
regularly, given the areas I&rsquo;m working on), I&rsquo;ll use some real hardware from
the lab. These platforms are the kind of platforms you&rsquo;ll find in every good
data center around the world: multiple top-of-the-line Xeon E5s, super-fast
NVMe SSD storage, the latest Intel NICs (SR-IOV compatible, of course) and
many, many GBs of RAM.</p>

      <h4>That&#39;s a lot of RAM</h4>

</figure>

    alt="Screenshot showing output of /proc/cpuinfo"><figcaption>
      <h4>One of many cores</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>
<p>While the hardware of the platforms I use does vary tremendously, the software
environments are remarkably consistent. To start, everything runs whatever the
latest version of Fedora happens to be - while Ubuntu may be currently <a href="https://www.openstack.org/assets/survey/April-2016-User-Survey-Report.pdf">the
most popular platform to deploy OpenStack on</a>, I&rsquo;ve used
Fedora at home for years and saw no reason to switch. On top of this, I either
deploy OpenStack using DevStack, if I want to validate a feature, or I simply
clone and work on the project repos directly, if I&rsquo;m working or unit-testable
code or &ldquo;low-hanging-fruit&rdquo; tasks. Finally, where required, I pre-configure my
tools using the configuration files provided by my <a href="https://github.com/stephenfin/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>
project.</p>
<figure><img src="https://that.guru/media/how-i-work-3.png"
    alt="Screenshot showing OpenStack projects I&#39;ve worked on"><figcaption>
      <h4>I work on a lot of projects</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="tooling">Tooling</h2>
<p>Tooling makes or breaks developers: learning what tools to use, and when, is an
important part of any developers own development. I know a lot of people who
use IDEs like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> (indeed, you can get a <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/How_To_Contribute#If_you.27re_a_developer">free community
license</a> if you contribute to OpenStack), but seeing as I don&rsquo;t
develop on my local machine, I need to use some form of remote rendering - VNC,
X11 forwarding, RDP - for the IDE GUI, I need to configure a remote mount so
that a local installed IDE could access files on my remote machines. I&rsquo;ve found
both of these options to perform poorly over bad connections and result in
either a janky, laggy UI or an inability to do things like change branches with
any regularity, respectively. Annoying, to say the least.</p>
<p>As a result of the above, I&rsquo;ve been slowly dropping GUI-based tools from my
toolkit over the years. The largest change here was my replacment of Sublime
Text and its plugins with Vim and plugins managed by <a href="https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim">Vundle</a>
(delighted not to be writing plugins for Vim, tbh). In addition to this change,
I also dropped <a href="http://meldmerge.org/">Meld</a>, which was pretty but laggy over X11 forwarding, in
favor of the more responsive <a href="https://github.com/rhysd/conflict-marker.vim">ConflictMarker</a> Vim plugin (I&rsquo;m
yet to grasp Vimdiff).  Similarly, I&rsquo;ve replaced MTPuTTY and its multiple tabs
with standard PuTTY and <a href="https://tmux.github.io/">tmux</a>. All these tools do have an additional
learning curve over their GUI-driven equivalents, but they&rsquo;re all
battle-tested, incredibly efficient, and work well on pretty much any type of
network connection.</p>
<figure><img src="https://that.guru/media/how-i-work-4.png"
    alt="Screenshot of Vim in tmux"><figcaption>
      <h4>I use Vim extensively</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Outside of these tools, I also make extensive use of <a href="https://github.com/openstack-infra/git-review">git-review</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">ag (a.k.a. the silver searcher)</a>. git-review allows me to quickly
submit my own changes for community review or download other peoples&rsquo; changes
for validation, and it is the tool the OpenStack community recommends for
working with Gerrit-based projects. ag, on the other hand, is my way of
handling the lack of an IntelliSense-like feature in Vim. It&rsquo;s a faster version
of <code>awk</code> that also takes things like gitignore files into account. I use this
to search for function calls etc. I plan to eventually try something like
<a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a> but I just haven&rsquo;t got around to this yet.</p>
<figure><img src="https://that.guru/media/how-i-work-5.png"
    alt="Screenshot of ag in tmux"><figcaption>
      <h4>ag is fast and pretty</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, debugging, where necessary, is possible through <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/pdb.html">pdb</a> and the odd
post to the mailing list is made using <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>. pdb, like many of these
tools, does take a bit of time to get your head around, but, once up and
running, proves itself worth the effort. mutt has a similarly large learning
curve, but it doesn&rsquo;t mess up the formatting of emails half as bad as Outlook
and its threading actually works.</p>
<h2 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h2>
<p>There are a couple of tools that have been recommended to me, that I just
haven&rsquo;t got around to trying yet.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dolph/next-review">git-next</a>: Developed by the awesome Dolph Matthews, this simple
tool should be configured with your favourite OpenStack project. Once done, you
can run it provide you with the next patch that you should review.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/openstack/gertty">gertty</a>: This is another OpenStack-provided project. This tool
provides a CLI for Gerrit tool, and allows you to do things like review code
offline. The latter feature isn&rsquo;t so useful when working remotely all the time,
but if/when I start developing locally, I&rsquo;ll be sure to use this.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi">Jedi</a>: As mentioned above, how I navigate the code base could do with
a bit of work. Jedi brings autocomplete and some other stuff to editors like
Vim.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a>: This is another one to throw in the &ldquo;if I ever develop
locally&rdquo; bag. I don&rsquo;t use this now, but if it becomes an option then I&rsquo;ll
definitely try it. I do wish the open source alternatives weren&rsquo;t quite
so&hellip;Java&rsquo;y though.</li>
<li>???: Who knows what else I&rsquo;ll discover in the coming years?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bonus-ssh-configuration">Bonus: SSH Configuration</h2>
<p>How I actually connect to the machines is probably worth calling out also. For
this, I use the PuTTY family of tools. To begin with, I have
<a href="https://github.com/FauxFaux/PuTTYTray">PuTTYTray</a> installed and pinned to my taskbar to enable quick
access to some tools in the suite (<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">PuTTY, Pageant, PuTTYGen</a>).</p>
<figure><img src="https://that.guru/media/how-i-work-6.png"
    alt="Screenshot of PuTTYTray"><figcaption>
      <h4>PuTTYTray in action</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The out-of-the-box experience for PuTTY itself is rather poor, so I rely on the
<a href="https://github.com/jblaine/solarized-and-modern-putty">Solarized Modern PuTTY Defaults project</a> to bring things into the
21st century.</p>
<figure><img src="https://that.guru/media/how-i-work-7.png"
    alt="Screenshot of PuTTY"><figcaption>
      <h4>Pretty colours. Not so pretty test results.</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I don&rsquo;t fancy typing in a password each time, so I <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-putty-on-digitalocean-droplets-windows-users">generate SSH keys using
Pageant</a>, then I make sure Pageant <a href="http://blog.shvetsov.com/2010/03/making-pageant-automatically-load-keys.html">starts automatically</a>
each time I boot my machine. I&rsquo;ll probably do a more in-depth write up of this
process at some point.</p>
