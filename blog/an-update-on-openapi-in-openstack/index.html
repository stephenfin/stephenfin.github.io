  <div class="admonition-content">Updated on 2025-04-15 to better describe the ongoing work in OSC and SDK.</div>
</aside>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The work to add OpenAPI schemas can be broken into two parts: adding schemas to services and writing tooling to consume
these schemas and generate both documentation and clients.</p>
<h3 id="services">Services</h3>
<p>The tl;dr: of this section is that we are relying on the fact that OpenAPI 3.1 is a superset of JSON Schema Draft
2020-12 and are adding JSON Schema schemas to as many services as possible. When put this way, it sounds pretty simple
but as is often the case, the devil is in the detail. OpenStack is made up of multiple independent services maintained
by different groups of people, and while the Oslo project has helped ensure some level of consistency around things like
configuration (<code>oslo.conf</code>), database connectivity (<code>oslo.db</code>) and messaging (<code>oslo.messaging</code>), there is huge variance
in the API frameworks used:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Nova, Cinder, Glance, and Manila use a combination of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Routes/">Routes</a> (for routing), <a href="https://pypi.org/project/WebOb/">WebOb</a> (for
request/response models), <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Paste/">Paste</a> (for application dispatch) and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PasteDeploy/">PasteDeploy</a> (for
middleware).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neutron uses the same Routes + WebOb + Paste + PasteDeploy combo used by Nova, Cinder, Glance, and Manila, but with
the addition of <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pecan/">Pecan</a> in place of the &ldquo;homegrown&rdquo; WSGI frameworks used in those projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keystone uses <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask/">Flask</a> and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/Flask-RESTful/">Flask-Restful</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swift uses PasteDeploy (but I admittedly know very little about Swift).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ironic uses Pecan (which in turn uses WebOb, so you&rsquo;ll see references to this too)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>etc etc&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, despite the wide differences in frameworks, they pretty much all have the same building blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Controllers (or Applications) which are responsible for a given resource and handles calls for same. These are
typically classes with methods for each HTTP verb that the API supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middleware that inspects and/or modifies requests and responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Routers that map a HTTP request to a controller. This is typically implemented as a special type of middleware.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this model, both parsing of requests and generation of responses happens in the controller methods, which makes this
a natural place to add validation for same. And there are a few things we want to validate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>API version (for services that uses <a href="https://that.guru/blog/api-versioning-in-openstack/">API microversions</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request path and query string parameters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request and response bodies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By wrapping the controller methods with decorators, we we are able to inspect both the request or response objects,
comparing them against schemas for same.</p>
<h3 id="tooling">Tooling</h3>
<p>Having schemas in place for all services is of little help if we don&rsquo;t do anything with them. To this end, we want
tooling that can inspect services and extract their JSON Schema schemas, combining them to produce OpenAPI
schemas.</p>
<p>Once we have these OpenAPI schemas, we can start generating (self-validating) documentation and clients/libraries. For
the former, OpenAPI will replace the <code>os-api-ref</code> Sphinx extension currently used across OpenStack. <code>os-api-ref</code> allows
us to describe our APIs in reStructuredText and it is a tool that has worked relatively well for us, but the lack of
machine readability means it&rsquo;s hard to validate against the code. For the latter, we hope to lessen the burden of
maintaining libraries and clients in multiple languages, as this has proven very challenging to do given the very large
number of OpenStack APIs in multiple. Once again, OpenAPI is better suited to this challenge than <code>os-api-ref</code> or
anything else we have.</p>
<h2 id="current-status-and-future-plans">Current status and future plans</h2>
<h3 id="nova">Nova</h3>
<p>Nova started from the best position, since it was already using JSON Schema for request validation. However, there were
a couple of issues to overcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The version of JSON Schema used for the schemas, Draft 04, is over 12 years old, meaning the schemas needed migrating
to Draft 2020-12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There were two different mechanisms for API versioning: if-else checks inside the controller methods, plus a decorator
that relied on the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/descriptor.html">descriptor protocol</a> to allow us to define
version-specific controller methods. The latter made inspection of the API router more difficult than necessary and
had to be replaced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While many APIs had request query string and request body schemas, not all of them did.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most importantly, there were no schemas for response bodies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these have now been resolved. We have bumped our schemas to Draft 2020-12, we have added all the missing request
schemas, and we have added response body schemas for a number of resources. The outstanding changes to address the API
versioning issues and add the remaining response body schemas are all ready and just waiting for review, so with any
luck we will be able to close this out in the 2025.2 (Flamingo) release. Once this work has merged, the final step will
be to start generating api-ref documentation from the OpenAPI schemas instead of using the <code>os-api-ref</code> tool we
currently use. The patches for Nova can be found <a href="https://review.opendev.org/q/project:openstack/nova+topic:openapi">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cinder">Cinder</h3>
<p>Cinder was in a very similar position to Nova thanks to their shared lineage. This means it had the same advantage -
pre-existing use of JSON Schema for request validation - and the same issues. However, it also had the added issue of
having a mountain of tech debt mainly related to the support for multiple API versions that Cinder offered until
relatively recently. This has necessitated a lot of additional cleanup patches to do things like remove the
<code>cinder.api.v2</code> module and consolidate everything under <code>cinder.api.v3</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while the bulk of the changes have been written, none of them have merged. I&rsquo;m hoping we can double down
on this in 2025.2 (Flamingo) release and start making some progress. The patches for Cinder can be found
<a href="https://review.opendev.org/q/project:openstack/nova+topic:openapi">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="keystone">Keystone</h3>
<p>Once again, Keystone had the good fortune of having existing use of JSON Schema for request query string and request
body validation, but this was done inconsistently and didn&rsquo;t cover response body schemas. Most of the work here has
focused on adding these missing schemas and making the router easier to inspect by moving validation from inside the
controller methods to decorators and splitting methods that previously handling multiple endpoints (e.g. <code>GET /foo</code> and
<code>GET /foo/123</code>) into multiple single-purpose methods.</p>
<p>Many resources have been fully specced by now but some remain. In addition, there are some decisions to be made
regarding support for undocumented API options that have been (re)discovered during this work. None of it should be
insurmountable, however. The patches for Keystone can be found
<a href="https://review.opendev.org/q/project:openstack/keystone+topic:openapi">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="manila">Manila</h3>
<p>Yet another service with JSON Schema already in place. Once again, the work here consists of adding missing schemas and
making the router easier to inspect. A small number of patches have merged here and more are in-flight. The patches for
Manila can be found <a href="https://review.opendev.org/q/project:openstack/manila+file:schemas">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ironic">Ironic</h3>
<p>Ironic hasn&rsquo;t historically used JSON Schema for validation, instead using its own homegrown validation framework and
taking advantage of some Pecan functionality to maintain API versioning. As a result, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of work needed
to get schemas into Ironic:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Move API versioning to decorators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rework request path, query string and body parameter validation to use JSON Schema schemas (via decorators) instead of
the homegrown framework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add request body parameter validation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This work is in very early stages, but there are people working on it and there appears to be broad buy-in from the
Ironic team, so I hope to see significant progress over the course of the 2025.2 (Flamingo) cycle. The patches for
Ironic can be found <a href="https://review.opendev.org/q/project:openstack/ironic+topic:openapi">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="other-services-neutron-swift-glance-octavia-">Other services (Neutron, Swift, Glance, Octavia, &hellip;)</h3>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, no work has been started in other projects. Of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; projects, I expect the Glance
effort to be relatively small since they already have formal schemas (exposed via the API!) for most of their resources.
Conversely, I expect the Neutron effort to be both large and complicated, given the number and highly dynamic nature of
Neutron&rsquo;s API, driven by it&rsquo;s extension-based &ldquo;versioning&rdquo; system. I have somehow never worked on Swift and haven&rsquo;t a
clue about that.</p>
<h3 id="tooling-1">Tooling</h3>
<p>There are two tooling-related efforts ongoing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of the <a href="https://opendev.org/openstack/codegenerator">codegenerator</a> project.</li>
<li>Improvements to the openstacksdk project, python-openstackclient project, and related projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>The codegenerator project provides a collection of utilities for generating OpenAPI schemas and a (Rust-based 🦀) client
from these schemas. Development on this tool first started in earnest during the 2024.1 (Caracal) cycle, but the tool has
continued to evolve over the course of the 2024.2 (Dalmatian) and 2025.1 (Epoxy) cycles. I expect to see more progress
as schemas continue to get added to the Nova project. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about this work, I&rsquo;d
encourage to review the following material from my upstream colleague, Artem Goncharov (gtema), who is driving much of
it.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gtema.github.io/slides/openstack_openapi/openapi_reveal.html">OpenStack OpenAPI specs: Building up OpenAPI specs for OpenStack APIs</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gtema.github.io/slides/rust_cli/rust_cli_reveal.html">OpenStack CLI rewritten in Rust</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The openstacksdk and python-openstackclient projects, meanwhile, are far more established. As a quick reminder, the
openstacksdk project provides the primary OpenStack client library, while the python-openstackclient project is the
primary OpenStack CLI. In recent releases, we&rsquo;ve been undertaking work to prepare them for a future when they can both
be at least partially auto-generated. This has taken the form of the addition of typing and a more general &ldquo;removal of
weirdness&rdquo; goal.</p>
<p>The addition of typing is probably easier to grok and easier to measure. To achieve this, we have been adding type hints
to openstacksdk and python-openstackclient, as well as dependencies of same. As of the 2025.1 (Epoxy) release, we have
full type coverage for keystoneauth (a dependency of openstacksdk) and for both cliff and osc-lib (dependencies of
python-openstackclient). We also have initial coverage of both openstacksdk and python-openstackclient themselves, with
more comprehensive coverage of some of the non-core aspects of the former. Completely typing openstacksdk in particular
though is more challenging due to the aforementioned weirdness, but we will continue to make progress on this over the
2025.2 (Flamingo) cycle.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;removal of weirdness&rdquo; goal is, as we noted, a little more general and cover a few related issues we&rsquo;re facing. The
two biggest of these, however, is (a) the over-use of variadic arguments and keyword arguments (<code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code>)
in the proxy and cloud layers in particular, and (b) the munging of request and response body parameters in the
<code>Resource</code> class used throughout openstacksdk. The former is hopefully self-explanatory so let&rsquo;s focus on the latter. By
way of a demonstration of the issue, consider the compute service&rsquo;s <code>/servers</code> API. This API expects you to pass
<code>networks</code> and <code>block_device_mapping_v2</code> fields in the request for <code>POST /servers</code>, to configure networking and block
devices respectively. However, it returns this information - in a different form, no less - via the <code>addresses</code> and
<code>os-extended-volumes:volumes_attached</code> in response to <code>GET /servers/{serverID}</code> and <code>GET /servers/detail</code>. Because we
currently munge the request and response body fields, our <code>Server</code> class therefore looks like this (in highly minimized
form):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Server</span>(resource<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>Resource):

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>But if you attempt to set either <code>addresses</code> or <code>attached_volumes</code> before a <code>Server.create</code> call, you will get an error.
On the other hand, if you do a <code>Server.fetch</code> or <code>Server.list</code> call, the <code>block_device_mapping</code> and <code>networks</code>
attributes will always be set to <code>None</code> since they don&rsquo;t form part of the response body. This has necessitated a whole
load of special casing in python-openstackclient, and special casing is bad for things you wish to auto-generate. By
separating these, we make it easier to type and easier to auto-generate. While a number of PoCs have been produced, none
have been implemented yet. We expect work on this to continue during the 2025.2 (Flamingo) cycle.</p>
