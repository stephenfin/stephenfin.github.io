    Building PDFs for OpenStack documentation

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <div class="document">


<p>I've only ever really worked with HTML and man page builds for the
documentation various of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/">various OpenStack projects</a>. However, OpenStack
uses Sphinx across the board and Sphinx, being the awesome tool that it is,
supports many other output formats. In this instance, I was interested in
<em>PDF</em>.</p>
<p>Sphinx doesn't actually provide a native PDF builder (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/builders.html#sphinx.builders.latex.LaTeXBuilder">although other packages
do</a>). Instead, you have to generate LaTeX sources and then generate a PDF for
this. This means you need to have a pretty well fleshed out TeX installation.
As such, the first step is to install the dependencies.</p>
<div class="section" id="install-dependendencies">
<h2>Install Dependendencies</h2>
<p>We need a number of packages to build the LaTeX sources and convert them into a
PDF. I'm using Fedora 27 which means package names may need to be adjusted
accordingly. Do note, however, that these names should work equally well on
RHEL and RHEL derivatives like CentOS).</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal">texlive</tt> (TeX Live)</p>
<p>Per the description of this package in the Fedora repos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TeX Live software distribution offers a complete TeX system for a
variety of Unix, Macintosh, Windows and other platforms. It encompasses
programs for editing, typesetting, previewing and printing of TeX documents
in many different languages, and a large collection of TeX macros and font
libraries.</p>
<p>The distribution includes extensive general documentation about TeX, as
well as the documentation for the included software packages.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the basic thing we need to actually build LaTeX documents and convert
them to PDF. The package itself includes multiple other dependencies, either
because they are necessary for a minimal install or they form a standard
library of sorts. I'm not sure which.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><tt class="docutils literal">latexmk</tt></p>
<p>Per the description of this package in the Fedora repos.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Latexmk is a perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times to
resolve cross references, etc.; it also runs auxiliary programs (bibtex,
makeindex if necessary, and dvips and/or a previewer as requested).  It has
a number of other useful capabilities, for example to start a previewer and
then run latex whenever the source files are updated, so that the previewer
gives an up-to-date view of the document.  The script runs on both UNIX and
MS-WINDOWS (95, ME, XP, etc).  This script is a corrected and improved
version of the original version of latexmk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a tool that Sphinx uses, via some makefiles it includes with the
built sources to ease converting the built LaTeX sources into PDFs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You also need a variety of other packages which aren't included as part of the
<tt class="docutils literal">texlive</tt> installation. The base Sphinx template has the following
requirements.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-fncychap</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-titlesec</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-tabulary</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-framed</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-wrapfig</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-upquote</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-capt-of</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-needspace</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, <tt class="docutils literal">openstackdocstheme</tt>, the theme used for all official OpenStack
projects, provides a LaTeX template with the following dependencies.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">texlive-polyglossia</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">I built this list manually by running <tt class="docutils literal">make</tt> and then installing whatever
dependency <tt class="docutils literal">latexmk</tt> complained about. There's probably easier ways to do
this, such as installing a larger package but I'm not aware of it at this
time.</p>
</div>
<p>Installation of all the above.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
$ sudo dnf install texlive latexmk texlive-fncychap texlive-titlesec <span class="literal string escape">\
</span>    texlive-tabulary texlive-framed texlive-wrapfig texlive-upquote <span class="literal string escape">\
</span>    texlive-capt-of texlive-needspace texlive-polyglossia
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="get-some-documentation">
<h2>Get Some Documentation</h2>
<p>I didn't have specific project in mind, so I've decided to build the project
documentation for the <tt class="docutils literal">openstackdocstheme</tt> project. As mentioned previously,
this project provides <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openstack/openstackdocstheme">the theme used for all Official OpenStack projects</a>.
Given that this is the base for most projects' documentation, it figures that
it contains all the necessary configuration to build PDFs. If, however, you are
planning to build docs for some other project, you should ensure that this is
project is <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.openstack.org/openstackdocstheme/latest/">configured correctly for PDF builds</a>.</p>
<p>To begin, clone the repo locally.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
$ git clone https://github.com/openstack/openstackdocstheme
</pre>
<p>Once cloned, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
$ virtualenv .venv
$ <span class="name builtin">source</span> .venv
$ pip install -e .
</pre>
<p>In the case of <tt class="docutils literal">openstackdocstheme</tt>, Sphinx isn't installed by default.
Let's install that too.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
$ pip install Sphinx
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="build-the-docs">
<h2>Build The Docs</h2>
<p>Now that we have both our dependencies and source documentation in place, it's
time to actually build some PDFs. Sphinx actually provides a number of helpful
targets in the Makefile generated by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sphinx-quickstart</span></tt>. However, OpenStack
projects don't tend to use these so we're going to take the (still exceedingly
simple) two-step process. Firstly, build the LaTeX sources. Seeing as this is a
Python project, we're going to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/setuptools.html">setuptools integration</a>.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
$ python setup.py build_sphinx -b latex
</pre>
<p>All OpenStack projects place their documentation source and builds in
<tt class="docutils literal">doc/source</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">doc/build</tt> respectively. The above command should
generate a number of files in <tt class="docutils literal">doc/build/latex</tt> including a very helpful
makefile. We're going to use that now to complete the process of generating a
PDF.</p>
<pre class="code shell literal-block">
$ make -C doc/build/latex
</pre>
<p>This should emit a <em>lot</em> of text, followed by something that looks like this.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Output written on os-doc-demo.pdf (23 pages).
Transcript written on os-doc-demo.log.
=== TeX engine is 'XeTeX'
Latexmk: Index file 'os-doc-demo.idx' was written
Latexmk: Log file says output to 'os-doc-demo.pdf'
Latexmk: All targets (os-doc-demo.pdf) are up-to-date
</pre>
<p>Once complete, you can find your compiled PDF in the same build directory (in
this case, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">doc/build/latex/os-doc-demo.pdf</span></tt>)</p>
