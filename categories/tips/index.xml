      <description>I recently updated to Fedora 28 which includes a updated version of tmux - tmux 2.7. I quickly noted that my window title was no longer being set as before and eventually identified the issue: a breaking change in 2.</description>

      <description>I started Evolution this morning and noticed half of my calendar events were missing. Attempts to refresh said calendar resulted in the following errors message:</description>

      <description>In OpenStack nova land, you run tests by specifying their Python paths, like so:
$ tox -e py27 nova.tests.unit.virt.libvirt.test_vif.LibvirtVifTestCase  This is also how tests are run and reported by the CI.</description>

      <title>Creating a Windows 7 USB on Fedora 25</title>
      <link>https://that.guru/blog/creating-a-windows-7-usb-on-fedora-25/</link>

      <guid>https://that.guru/blog/creating-a-windows-7-usb-on-fedora-25/</guid>
      <description>Turns out Fedora 25 didn&amp;rsquo;t like my Samsung Series 9 (NP900X4C) much. Among other things, the WiFi was intermittent (weird, as it&amp;rsquo;s an Intel NIC), suspend didn&amp;rsquo;t work (the laptop is always dead when I come to it), and the keyboard backlight turned off immediately after turning it on.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I last wrote a non-trivial amount of Java and I can&amp;rsquo;t say I miss it. However, I want to work on a plugin for Jenkins which means diving back in.</description>

      <title>MTUs in Neutron</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not overly familiar with neutron but it appears that in the past correctly setting MTU values was easier said than done. This has been massively improved in recent releases, but getting us to this point required a lot of work and, in particular, a lot of changes to the MTU-related configuration options available over the course of Liberty and Newton.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I had to work with Jenkins directly (since I started on OpenStack, really). However, I had a few tricks picked up around plugins for Chrome that make working with pre-3.</description>

      <title>Sane Outlook: Making Plain Text Better in Outlook</title>
      <link>https://that.guru/blog/sane-outlook/</link>

      <guid>https://that.guru/blog/sane-outlook/</guid>
      <description>I like well-formatted, plain text emails, and I like reading them in a monospace font. I find plain text to be more readable, and provides less ways for people to impact this legibility.</description>

      <description>Next Friday is the last week of this stint at Intel, so I figured now was as good a time as ever to do a write up on how I work, or, more accurately, how I&amp;rsquo;ve worked, during my time here.</description>
